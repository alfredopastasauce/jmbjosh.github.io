                        BATS Improv is a professional theatre company and an artistic community that cultivates and innovates the craft of improvised theatre through engaging, playful, creative performance and training.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Founded in 1986, we are the most highly acclaimed and longest-running improvised theatre company and school in San Francisco and all of Northern California.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        BATS Improv is more than a theatre company and a school. We are a center for improvised theatre — an integrated universe of improv. We are a community of people who share our vision, who want to challenge themselves, have fun, and connect with others who feel the same way.

                <h2>History of BATS Improv</h2>
                <div class="bodyCopy">
                    <p>
                        BATS Improv traces its philosophical roots back to the work of Keith Johnstone, author of Impro, creator of TheatresportsTM, and one of the few internationally recognized authorities on improvised theatre.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        During his tenure at the London Royal Court Theatre in the 1950s and 60s, Johnstone developed a series of improvisational exercises to help playwrights overcome writer’s block by short-circuiting the natural tendency to edit themselves. He captured this work in his first book, Rebecca Stockley, a teacher from Seattle Theatresports, to lead a workshop and teach the Theatresports format.

                <div class="bodyCopy">
                    <p>
                        We envision a world where everyone is comfortable in their own skin, where ideas and flights of fancy are encouraged, respected, and given wondrous, unimaginable form through spirited, skillful collaboration.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where life itself is recognized as improvisational and the skills of improvised theatre are embraced as life skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Where the art of improvised theatre is broadly enjoyed and the BATS style of storytelling is acknowledged as an essential way to celebrate our shared experience.

                <p class="bodyCopy">
                    The BATS Main Stage Company is an ensemble of highly skilled actors specializing in spontaneity. Recognized as San Francisco’s premiere improvised theatre troupe, the BATS Company includes some of the country’s most talented improv actors — many of whom have shaped the artform of improvised theatre. Each is a master of the BATS style of improv, artistically expressing the hilarity, and poignancy, of the human condition.

                    <p>
                        Catalyzed by the murder of George Floyd, the moment of national reckoning with the ongoing and devastating impacts of systemic racism, and the light this has shone on institutional racism within the theater sector, BATS Improv has committed itself to internal examination and reinvention to succor the eradication of racism and white supremacy that is endemic within theater in America and its manifestation at BATS. Our work has been informed by ‘The Living Document of BIPOC Experiences in the Bay Area Theater Community,’ published on the 9th of June, and more specifically by the ‘BIPOC Equity Action Plan’ published in summer 2020.

                    The first thing to learn about improv is that you’re not in it alone. As a nonprofit San Francisco institution, we feel strongly about giving back to the Bay Area community that sustains us as we build an improvised theatre community from the grassroots.
